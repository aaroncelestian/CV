# CV Aaron J. Celestian, Ph.D.

*I research how minerals interact with their environments and with living things.*

**Updated:** December 2, 2024

---

## Summary

I am a researcher focused on understanding how minerals interact with their environments and living systems, with an emphasis on using these interactions to address global challenges such as climate change, pollution, and disease. My ongoing work spans experimental design, real-time material characterization, mineral discovery and application, and the functionalization of minerals. By developing novel nano-crystalline Earth materials, I aim to create innovative solutions for a range of demanding applications.

In addition to my research, I hold adjunct faculty positions at the University of Southern California and West Los Angeles College. I also oversee the Gem & Mineral Hall at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, where I regularly design and curate mineral science exhibits.
